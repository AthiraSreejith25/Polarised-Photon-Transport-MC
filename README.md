# Monte Carlo Simulations of Polarised Photon Transport in Scattering Media

Simulated polarised photon scattering (using cylindrical optical fibre as source) in anisotropic micro‚Äêsphere solution using Euler Monte Carlo method to compute the Mueller matrix of the medium.

Check out Polarised_Photon_simulation_Final_Report.pdf (not ...progress_report.pdf)\
Check out the animations in the "Animations" and "2d_photon_trajectories" directories as well.

polarised_2.1.sim.py is the simulation code\
polarised_2.1.anim.py is the animation code\
2d_isophotscat.py is the 2D scattering animation code

polarised_2.1.mueller_enhanced.py and polarised_2.1.plot.py are the plotting codes
